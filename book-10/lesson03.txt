Excuse me for interrupting
If you ask me something, I tend to think that
Up to a point, I agree with you, but
Do you see what I am getting at?
Let me put this another way
Would you mind if
I wonder if you could
Could you run that by me another time?
I am afraid I don't quite understand what you are getting at.
Has anyone else got anything to contribute?
That's not quite what I had in mind.
Please, be brief
I'm afraid we've run out of time.
I'm afraid that's outside the scope of this meeting.
That's not really why we're here today.
Why don't we returned to the main focus of today's meeting.
We're beginning to lose sight of the main point.
I think we had better leave that for another meeting.
It looks as though we've covered the main items.
Is there any other business?
Shall we fix the next meeting?
Before we close, let me just summarize the main points
Thank you all for attending
